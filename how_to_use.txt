### HOW TO USE ###

- Fill in data_file.txt with the data required
- Save data_file.txt
- Run program

You can modify parameters for pings and SSH/Telnet sessions using .cfg file.

Understanding "device_type" entry in .cfg file (See [device_type_supported_PLATFORMS.txt] located in "info" directory to get more info):

	Connection mode (SSH/Telnet) is based on "device_type" value configured in .cfg file.
	Selecting a device_type with "telnet" keyword will perform Telnet, else SSH.

	- SSH:
	      device_type: autodetect -> Program will detect the best match to set device_type and perform SSH session.
	      device_type: generic -> Program will use generic settings to perform SSH session. Use only if you do not know target device vendor.

	- TELNET:
	      device_type: generic_telnet -> Program will use generic settings to perform Telnet session. Use only if you do not know target device vendor.

	Using generic device_types (generic, generic_telnet), may cause issues performing SSH/Telnet sessions (especially generic_telnet). Use at your own risk.

You can place files containing commands in "config_files" directory and use that files to apply the commands contained in them.
(e.g in data_file.txt -> -COMMANDS: -> <import=filename.txt> -> program will take commands from filename.txt and will apply them to devices)

A log file located in "logs" directory will be created after program ends successfully.

If you run program and "data_file.txt" file, ".cfg" file, "config_files" directory or "logs" directory are not found, program will create them automatically with default values.
